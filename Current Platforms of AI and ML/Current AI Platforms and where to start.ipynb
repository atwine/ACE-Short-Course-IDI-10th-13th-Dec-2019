    "\n",
    "- It is an API designed with user friendly implementation as the core principle. The API is designed to be simple and consistent, and it minimises the effort programmers are required to put in to convert theory into action.\n",
    "- Keras’ modular design is another important feature. The primary idea of Keras is layers, which can be connected seamlessly.\n",
    "- Keras is extensible. If you are a researcher trying to bring in your own novel functionality, Keras can accommodate such extensions.\n",
